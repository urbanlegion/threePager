        <h1>Q: Which is a better syntax for if condition, and why?</h1>
        <p>a. if ("John" == $name)</p>
        <p>b. if ($name == "John")</p>
        <h1>Answer</h1>
        <p>Let's start by saying that it 100% works, yet I would have to say that B is the correct answer,
            not only because it's considered best practice but i'm just assuming that
            the compiler plays some part here when it's
            looking for a var that contains the string "John", while in B, the compiler already has the
            var to check if it contains the string "John", that's my unchecked assumption. </p>
        <p> Moreover, language as in any language, has certain syntax boundaries, not only for compilers but
            for other human coders as well. While no coder has ever asked "if the chocolate is cake",
            many coders do ask "if the cake is chocolate", common practice.</p>

        <h1>Q: What would be the output of the following class</h1>
        <pre class="prettyprint" lang-html>
class student{
    protected $name;
    protected $lastName;

    public function setName($name){
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function setLastName($lastName){
        $this->lastName = $lastName;
    }

    public static function getName(){
        return $this->name;
    }

    public static function getLastName(){
        return $this->lastName;
    }
}
        </pre>
        <h1>And the following script:</h1>
        <pre class="prettyprint" lang-php>
$student = new student()
$student->setName('John');
$student->SetLastName('Doe');
$fullName = $student->getName.' '.$student->getLastName();
        </pre>
        <h1>Answer</h1>
        <p>You cannot use the $this on a static method since
        static methods don't have objects associated with them.
        What would work perfectly would be using the
            <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.paamayim-nekudotayim.php">'paamayim nekudotiam'</a>
        to call these methods, but then again, a static method would have to be something <strong>un-dynamic</strong> (as it's called: static)
        such as a constant, even date/time (even though time changes, it would always show "a time" and not any
            other inter-changeable or conditional event driven result, it would stay as a time result.</p>
        <p>Judging by the nature of this class, it is supposed to be dynamic, hence I would remove the static
        keyword from both methods and happily use $this to call them from the object instantiated.</p>
